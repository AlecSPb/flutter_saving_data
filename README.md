## Setup

You can clone this project or start a new project with the same name and copy over the following three files:

- [pubspec.yaml](https://github.com/suragch/flutter_saving_data/blob/master/pubspec.yaml)
- [main.dart](https://github.com/suragch/flutter_saving_data/blob/master/lib/main.dart)
- [database_helpers.dart](https://github.com/suragch/flutter_saving_data/blob/master/lib/database_helper.dart)

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
